General structure and brainstorming on how to approach project

1. Defining the Scope and Purpose
Questions or Problems Addressed:
One question we can address and explore is hich genres have gained or lost popularity over the years? What external factors (like social, political, technological changes) might correlate with these trends?

Reading Files: If you have supplemental data in files (like historical box office data), plan on how to integrate it.
3. Data Processing
Data Cleaning: Address missing or inconsistent data.
Data Integration: Join data from the API and other sources. Ensure consistency.
Unstructured Data: If dealing with text (like reviews), consider natural language processing techniques.
Storage: Use efficient data structures, or a database like SQLite for larger datasets.
4. Visualization and Methodology
Python Libraries for Visualization:
Matplotlib and Seaborn for statistical charts.
Plotly for interactive visualizations.
Geopandas for geographical data (if analyzing data by location).
Visualization Best Practices: Ensure clarity, accuracy, and relevance to your hypothesis.
Methodology: Tailor your analytical methods to your specific questions. For example, use time-series analysis for trend data, or sentiment analysis for reviews.
5. Additional Python Libraries
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Requests: To make API calls.
Beautiful Soup or Scrapy: For web scraping (if needed).
NLTK or SpaCy: For natural language processing (if dealing with text data).
SQLAlchemy: If using a database for data storage.
Scikit-learn: For any machine learning components.
Project Tips:
Iterative Approach: Start with a simple question and expand as you go.
Documentation: Keep track of your data sources and transformations.
Code Organization: Write clean, well-documented code to make your project understandable and reproducible.
Ethical Considerations: Respect copyright and privacy laws, especially when scraping.
